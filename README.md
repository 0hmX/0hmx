Hi, I am Ohmx. I enjoy binary and low-level API. It's my dream to build the next HTML and Javascript! I prefer to work from home and drink tea! If you have any questions, please email me!

I also have a YouTube channel [TheAnkanOfficial](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAnkanOfficial) I like to make tutorials and share random facts about software!
