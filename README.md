I write highly optimized JavaScript and modernize legacy code by leveraging cutting-edge techniques like Web Streams, Transform Streams, Web Workers, Service Workers, WebAssembly (Wasm), alongside advanced Node.js APIs such as worker_threads, AsyncLocalStorage, and AbortController/AbortSignal, to help corporations maximize their infrastructure.

I also have a YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAnkanOfficial) I like to make tutorials and share random facts about software!
